Feature: Service Should Generate a Proxy
  In order to consume the OData
  As a user
  I want to be able to access data

Background:
  Given a HTTP ODataService exists
  And blueprints exist for the service

Scenario: Service should respond to valid collections
  Then I should be able to call "Categories" on the service

# Scenario: Service should not respond to an invalid collection
#   Then I should not be able to call "X" on the service
# 
# Scenario: Service should respond to accessing a single entity by ID
#   Then I should be able to call "Categories" on the service with args: "1"
# 
# Scenario: Access an entity by ID should return the entity type
#   Given I call "AddToCategories" on the service with a new "Category" object with Name: "Test Category"
#   And I save changes
#   And I call "Categories" on the service with args: "1"
#   When I run the query
#   Then the first result should be of type "Category"
# 
# Scenario: Entity should have the correct accessors
#   Given I call "AddToCategories" on the service with a new "Category" object with Name: "Test Category"
#   And I save changes
#   And I call "Categories" on the service with args: "1"
#   When I run the query
#   Then the first result should have a method: "Id"
#   And the first result should have a method: "Name"
# 
# Scenario: Entity should fill values
#   Given I call "AddToCategories" on the service with a new "Category" object with Name: "Test Category"
#   And I save changes
#   And I call "Categories" on the service with args: "1"
#   When I run the query
#   Then the method "Id" on the first result should equal: "1"
#   And the method "Name" on the first result should equal: "Test Category"
# 
# Scenario: Navigation Properties should be included in results
#   Given I call "AddToProducts" on the service with a new "Product" object
#   And I save changes
#   And I call "Products" on the service with args: "1"
#   When I run the query
#   Then the first result should have a method: "Category"
#   And the method "Category" on the first result should be nil
#
