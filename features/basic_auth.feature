Feature: Service Should Access Basic Auth Protected Resources

Background:
  Given a HTTP BasicAuth ODataService exists using username "admin" and password "passwd"
  And blueprints exist for the service

  Scenario: Service should respond to valid collections
    Then I should be able to call "Products" on the service

  Scenario: Entity should fill values on protected resource
    Given I call "AddToCategories" on the service with a new "Category" object with Name: "Auth Test Category"
    And I save changes
    And I call "Categories" on the service with args: "1"
    When I run the query within a cassette named "basic_auth_protected_resource"
    Then the method "Id" on the first result should equal: "1"
    And the method "Name" on the first result should equal: "Auth Test Category"

  Scenario: Should get 401 if invalid credentials provided to protected URL
    Given a HTTP BasicAuth ODataService exists using username "admin" and password "bad_pwd" it should throw an exception with message "the server responded with status 401"

  Scenario: Should get 401 if no credentials provided to protected URL
    Given a HTTP BasicAuth ODataService exists it should throw an exception with message "the server responded with status 401"
